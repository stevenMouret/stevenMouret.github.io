        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Some words about me.</p>
        <p>My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-mouret-1b693260/">Steven Mouret</a>, I'm a french UX/UI developer and accessibility expert. I mainly work on the creation of websites for local authorities and public institutions at Stratis.</p>
        <p>I have been working for many years in accessibility and I was mainly trained by <a href="https://atalan.fr">Atalan</a> and <a href="https://www.braillenet.org/en/">Braillenet</a> association that is <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/Testimonial/#t1256">member of the W3C</a>.</p>
        <p>I am part of the AccessiWeb working group, this French group brings together the majority of experts in the field of accessibility in France.</p>
        <p>I became an expert in 2012 following several training and certification courses.</p>
        <p>I had the chance to be trained by a French reference in accessibility, M. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jean-pierre-villain-b8a52033/">Jean Pierre Villain</a>.</p>
        <p>I don't want to tell you that accessibility is good for search engines, that it improves ergonomics, that it makes it easier to see content on your smartphone in direct sunlight and many others.</p>
        <p>These things are true but we do not make accessibility for that, we do it to give everyone equal opportunities in our society.</p>
        <p>Digital technology is an opportunity to build this society. To do this, applications and websites must be designed and built according to the principles of digital accessibility.</p>
        <p>I have gathered on this website many resources on accessibility and more specifically on the French reference system the RGAA (French government's General Accessibility Reference for Administrations).</p>
